    <h1>Welcome to CART 351 Exercise Two</h1>
    <p>This Flask exercise demonstrates how to use Flask routes, HTML templates, and the Jinja templating engine.</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <p>
    I built a Flask web application that includes multiple routes and templates. 
    The <strong>/t1</strong> page displays variables using Jinja — including lists, conditionals, and images — 
    while the <strong>/t2</strong> page demonstrates a form using the GET method that combines user input and 
    replaces all vowels with asterisks.

    <h2>Issues I Encountered</h2>
    <ul class="indent-list">
        <li>At first, my web server wasn’t running properly. I kept seeing an error that said 
        <code>Access to 127.0.0.1 was denied</code> (HTTP 403).I didn’t immediately know whether 
        the issue came from my Flask code, my local environment, or my browser.</li>
        <li>I used ChatGPT to help me work through the debugging process step by step. 
        ChatGPT guided me to test the connection through the terminal using the command:<code>curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/</code></li>
        <li>This showed that the request wasn’t actually reaching my Flask application, which helped confirm that the
        issue wasn’t caused by my code but rather something with how the local server was being accessed. 
        ChatGPT walked me through multiple troubleshooting steps — trying different ports, disabling possible 
        conflicts, running Flask without the reloader, and confirming that the app was set to <code>app.run(debug=True)</code>.</li>
        <li>Eventually the server launched properly and my project began loading as expected.
        Through this process I learned how to read terminal responses, interpret HTTP error codes, 
        and identify whether an issue comes from the code or from the system environment.
        This debugging session also helped me understand the importance of checking the console output,
        server logs, and using tools like <code>curl</code> to trace what’s really happening</li>
    </ul>

<section class="card">
    <h2>What was the error?</h2>
    <p>Technically — the problem was AirPlay using port 5000 on my system.</p>
    <ul class="indent-list">
        <li>Flask normally starts its dev server on port 5000.</li>
        <li>macOS Monterey and newer reserve that same port for AirPlay Receiver (AirTunes).</li>
        <li>So when <code>http://127.0.0.1:5000/</code> opened, the request never reached Flask — 
        it was intercepted by AirPlay, which replied “403 Forbidden.”</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Through this exercise, I learned how Flask connects routes to templates, how GET data travels through the URL, 
    and how small configuration issues (like port conflicts) can stop a server from running. 
    I also learned how Jinja variables make it easy to reuse dynamic data in HTML templates. 
    This project helped me strengthen both my Python and front-end debugging skills.
