Unsent Confessions Overview:
- Anonymous, networked web application inspired by The Unsent Project. It allows users to write messages they never sent and post them to a shared public wall. Messages appear as color-coded cards, tagged by emotion, and can be explored, filtered, and searched collectively.
- The project focuses on anonymity, emotional expression, and collective participation rather than identity. There are no user accounts or profiles; instead, contributions exist as part of a shared archive shaped by all visitors.

Technical Overview:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Hosting: Local

AI Use:
- Had assistance from ChatGPT for troubleshooting and setting up the MongoDB Atlas connection and resolving SSL-related configuration issues on macOS.

Running the Project:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- Add a .env file with the MongoDB connection string
- Run python app.py
